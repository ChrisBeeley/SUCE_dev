At the present time we collect patient feedback data on proprietary software on iPads. This costs £800 a year as well as limiting what we can do with the software (e.g. no interactive team selection, no functionality to download data from the server and explore other people's responses).

As a side project (evenings and weekends whenever I can) I have decided to try to emulate and improve the functionality of the software on Android. It's my first foray into Java proper (have done a basics course but there was no coverage of GUIs, net functionality, or building full applications) and I certainly know nothing at all about developing for Android.

The aim is to produce an app which will allow us to collect data, upload it to a central repository, and download the whole dataset and allow users of the app to explore the data for themselves.

I hope this project will either:

1) Make me a better Java/ Android programmer
2) The above and be a useful resource for others learning the same things (look at historical commits to see how the code built up over time)
3) The above and save us £800 a year and give a better mobile data collection platform for live use in the Trust
4) The above and be something the wider NHS or other health providers can take, modify, and use for their own purposes.

Time will tell how successful I am, but I'm sure I will have a lot of fun trying :-)
